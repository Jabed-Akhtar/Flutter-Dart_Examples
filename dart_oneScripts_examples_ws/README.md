## Variables & Data types

### List
- same as list in Python :).

### Maps & HashMaps
- Maps: same as dict in Python :).

### Final vs Const Keyword
```Dart  
final String name;  
name = "Zaxx";  
```
- final: The variable cannot be changed, but new item to the List can be added.

```Dart  
const name = "Zaxx";  
```
- const: Neither the variable can be chaned, nor new item to the List can be added.

## Conditionals
### If

## Loops
### For-Loop

### While-Loop
